## Things it can do
- Basic operations: Downloading, uploading, viewing, copying, moving, cutting, renaming and deleting files.
- You can sort by: Name, last modification date, size, type
- Create new files and directories
- File sharing: It can generate a URL for a file you want to share, so anyone with the link can access the file. You can also set an expiration date on the link.

## Keyboard navigation
I designed the whole frontend so that it can be easily navigated using a keyboard. There are also keyboard shortcuts for every feature.
## Plans for the future
- I plan on making it support the FTP, SMB/CIFS and SFTP protocols.
